VIM looks sucks to me, the idea of writing document all by keyboard is good, buthow vim made it is stupid. 

While, anyway, I still cannot deny that vim is usefull and there is no altinative way to type something in your PC YET.

I have to learn it. At least knowing something.

The painful part is, you have to remember a lot of short-cuts. Let me list a few of them.

:w	means Write
:q	means Quit
:w [filename]	You guess
:r [filename]   append content in given file to current cursor.

That the most basic operations.

While, most application has built-in help document. VIM too. 

:h	Show help document

but as you can guess, this document could be rather huge. So the whole file was expectedly splitted into many files introducing difference topics.
